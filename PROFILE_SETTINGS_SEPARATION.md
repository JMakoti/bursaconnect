# Profile vs Settings Separation

## Overview
I've successfully separated the overlapping features between the Profile and Settings pages to create a cleaner, more logical user experience.

## Profile Page Features (Personal & Professional Info)
**File:** `lib/Admin/Screens/Profile/admin_profile_page.dart`

### Personal Information Section:
- Full Name
- Username  
- Email Address
- Phone Number
- Date of Birth
- Gender
- Profile Picture Management (camera/gallery)

### Professional Information Section:
- Role/Position
- Department
- Admin-specific details

### Key Features:
- Edit/View mode toggle
- Form validation
- Image picker integration
- Clean, focused UI for personal data management

## Settings Page Features (System & Application Settings)
**File:** `lib/Admin/Screens/Settings/admin_settings_page.dart`

### Application Settings Section:
- Notifications toggle
- Dark Mode toggle
- Language selection

### Security & Privacy Section:
- Security settings configuration
- Password change functionality

### System Settings Section:
- Auto backup toggle
- Data management (backup/restore)

### Admin Controls Section (New):
- User Management
- System Analytics

### Support & Help Section:

- Focused Profile on user identity and personal data

### 3. Enhanced Settings Page:

- Fixed deprecated Flutter widgets (`activeColor` â†’ `activeThumbColor`)

### 4. Improved Profile Page:
- Cleaner, more focused design
- Better form organization
- Professional information section for admin context
- Streamlined editing experience

### 5. Fixed Technical Issues:
- Updated deprecated Flutter widgets

## Usage Guidelines:

### When to use Profile Page:
- Updating personal information
- Changing profile picture
- Viewing/editing professional details
- Managing user identity

### When to use Settings Page:

This separation provides a more intuitive user experience where users know exactly where to find specific types of settings and information.
